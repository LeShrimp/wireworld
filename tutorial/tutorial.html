    <section class="tutorial">
        <p>Welcome to Wireworld. In Wireworld space is discrete. It consists of cells, arranged in a grid.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww1"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>Cells come in four &quot;states&quot;, which are from left to right: Black, Copper, Electron head and Electron tail.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww2"></canvas>
            <canvas id="ww3"></canvas>
            <canvas id="ww4"></canvas>
            <canvas id="ww5"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>Not only space, but also time is discrete in Wireworld. Although cells never move, they
        may change their state from one point in time to the other.</p>
        <p>Black cells always stay black.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww6"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>Electron tails become Copper.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww7"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>Electron heads become Electron tails.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww8"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>And finally a cell in Copper state switches to Electron head state if one or two of its
        neighbours are in Electron head state.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww9"></canvas>
            <canvas id="ww10"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>Sounds pretty boring, doesn't it? Let's take a look at the bigger picture.</p>
        <div>
            <canvas id="ww11"></canvas>
        </div>
        <p>Keep in mind that movement is illusion in Wireworld!</p>
